        <h3>Travelling in Mauritius</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-box">
        <br>Mauritius offers the perfect blend of adventure and convenience, with its size making all attractions easily
        accessible. No need to worry about long travel distances—everything is within reach, so get ready to explore!
        Whether you prefer organized excursions, renting a car, or using public transport, there are numerous ways to
        get around. For the best local tips, be sure to consult your hotel reception or concierge desk.

        <h3>How big is Mauritius?</h3>
        <p>The east to the west coast spans approximately 45 km and takes around 1 hour 15 minutes to drive across. The
            north to the south of the island is approximately 61 km and takes around 1 hour 20 minutes to drive. The
            island covers 2030 sq km and is home to beaches, mountains, national parks, fishing villages and the capital
            city of Port Louis.</p>

        <p>The island has quite a clear network of roads, with the three main ones being:</p>
        <p>-M3, which links Terre Rouge to Verdun in the North, passing through Port-Louis, the capital.</p>
        <p>-M2, which links Port Louis to the tourist village of Grand Baie, in the North of the island</p>
        <p>-M1, which links the airport in the South East to Port Louis. This is the most important road on the island
            since it also passes through the largest cities of Curepipe, Vacoas, Quatre-Bornes, Phoenix, Beau-Bassin
            Rose Hill and Moka.</p>

        <h2>How to travel around Mauritius</h2>
        <h3><b>Organised excursions</b></h3>
        <p>There are plenty of local tourist operators who offer organised excursions across the island and boat trips
            to the islets surrounding Mauritius. These can often be booked through hotels and itineraries include both
            half-day and full-day tours. You can expect to travel in minibuses for group excursions, depending on the
            size of the group. For those wanting more flexibility without driving, it’s possible to arrange a private
            tour guide. An experienced local driver will pick you up and take you on a bespoke tour of the island at
            your own pace. Always book organised excursions and private tours with reputable companies with an official
            licence to ensure compliance with security standards and measures. The licences issued by the tourism
            authority include:

            Tourist Accommodation Certificate,
            Tourist Enterprise Licence,
            Pleasure Craft Licence, and
            Skipper’s Licence.</p>

        <h3><b>Public Bus</b></h3>
        <img src="..//images/photos/bus.jpg">
        <p>Experience Mauritian life by exploring the island via bus. Unlike the metro, the bus network covers the
            entire island, offering an affordable way to interact with friendly locals. Mauritius has two types of
            buses: standard and express. Whenever possible, opt for an express bus, as they are faster and equipped with
            air-conditioning.

            In urban areas, buses run from 5:30 am to 8:00 pm, and from 6:30 am to 6:30 pm in rural areas. There is also
            a late-night service between Port Louis and Curepipe until 11:00 pm. Buses generally arrive every 15
            minutes, though express buses are less frequent. It&#39;s a good idea to check the bus schedule with your
            host
            or hotel reception before heading out to ensure a smooth trip.</p>

        <h3><b>Taxi</b></h3>
        <img src="..//images/photos/taxi.jpg">
        <p>In the evenings, locals frequently opt for taxis when buses are no longer running. Taxis can be found near
            hotels and shopping malls, though it&#39;s advisable to arrange them through your accommodation, as they can
            recommend reliable service providers. It&#39;s important to agree on the fare upfront before beginning your
            journey. While Mauritius doesn&#39;t have Uber, apps like Yougo offer a convenient alternative for booking
            taxis
            and paying a set fare for your ride.</p>

        <h3><b>Metro Express</b></h3>
        <img src="..//images/photos/metro.jpg">
        <p>The Metro Express in Mauritius is a modern light rail transit system designed to provide efficient
            transportation across key areas of the island. It connects the capital, Port Louis, with Curepipe in the
            south, covering a distance of approximately 26 kilometers. The Metro Express offers a comfortable and
            reliable way for tourists to explore various attractions, including shopping centers, cultural sites, and
            scenic spots along its route. It operates from early morning to late evening, making it convenient for both
            locals and visitors to commute and explore Mauritius.</p>

        <h3><b>Car rentals</b></h3>
        <p>If you prefer to explore Mauritius on your own schedule, renting a car is a great option. It provides the
            highest level of freedom and flexibility since you won&#39;t be restricted by public transport schedules.
            Renting a car in Mauritius is straightforward and cost-effective. Many rental companies offer delivery
            services to your hotel, and you can also find popular international car rental agencies at the airport. Be
            sure to bring a valid driver&#39;s license and a map or GPS for navigation. Note that driving is on the left
            side of the road, and vehicles coming from the right have the right of way.</p>

        <h3><b>Walking and hiking</b></h3>
        <img src="..//images/photos/walk.png">
        <p>Why not take your time and explore Mauritius on foot? The island is a hiker&#39;s dream, boasting a variety
            of
            natural landscapes. You can wander through tropical forests to discover hidden waterfalls, ascend mountain
            peaks for breathtaking views, and traverse vast plains dotted with ancient lava boulders.

            There are trails to suit all fitness levels, ranging from strenuous hikes to leisurely walks. Consult your
            hotel or host for the best local walking trails or venture onto popular routes like Le Morne Brabant and
            Black River Gorges National Park. Don&#39;t forget to wear sunscreen and suitable walking shoes. Carry
            plenty of
            water and always inform someone of your plans. It&#39;s also advisable to hike with a local, certified
            guide.

            If you&#39;re in Port Louis, the city center is easily walkable. Le Caudan Waterfront, Central Market,
            Aapravasi
            Ghat, and Chinatown are all within close proximity to one another.</p>

        <h3><b>Bikes and e-bikes</b></h3>
        <img src="..//images/photos/bike.jpg">
        <p>Bikes and e-bikes are the most eco-friendly forms of wheeled transportation, allowing access to areas that
            cars cannot reach. Many hotels across the island offer bicycle rentals or can direct you to local companies
            with affordable rates.

            For those who prefer not to travel alone, some island companies offer mountain biking tours throughout
            Mauritius. Ensure you choose the right bike for your needs. A push bike is perfect for exploring nearby
            casual routes, while an e-bike is ideal for touring the island, providing extra stamina for more challenging
            roads.</p>
