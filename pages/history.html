                            <p>Government House is one of the most historic buildings in Port Louis, the capital city of
                                Mauritius. Dubbed as the oldest building of the capital, it was built during the French
                                colonisation era and served as the residence of the first French governor of Mauritius.
                                The construction of this building was supervised by the governor himself, and its
                                architecture is typical of the period.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>One of the most striking features of the Government House is the statue of Queen Victoria
                                that stands in front of the building. The statue was erected during the British colonial
                                period and is a testament to the island&#39;s colonial history. The statue portrays
                                Queen
                                Victoria with an air of un-amused indifference, which is quite characteristic of her

                                body. Operating under a unicameral system, it consists of the National Assembly, where
                                elected Members of Parliament (MPs) represent constituencies across the island. The

                                government&#39;s work. Located in Port Louis, the Parliament building symbolises the

                <h1>History of Mauritius</h1>
                <p>Mauritius has a rich and diverse history, with influences from Dutch, French, and British colonisers.
                    The island was first discovered by Arab sailors in the 9th century, but it remained uninhabited
                    until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. The Dutch were the first to establish a
                    settlement in 1638, but they abandoned it in 1710 due to harsh living conditions.</p>
                <p>The French took control of the island in 1715 and developed the sugar industry, which became a
                    cornerstone of the island&#39;s economy. In 1810, the British captured Mauritius, and it remained a
                    British colony until it gained independence in 1968. The legacy of these various cultures can be
                    seen in the island&#39;s architecture, cuisine, and traditions.</p>
                <p>Today, Mauritius is known for its political stability, vibrant culture, and as a melting pot of
                    different ethnicities and religions. The history of Mauritius is a testament to its resilience and
                    ability to adapt to changing circumstances.</p>

                    <p>Mauritius achieved independence from British rule on March 12, 1968, with Sir Seewoosagur

                        movement, Ramgoolam is honoured as the "Father of the Nation." This pivotal moment marked the
                        transition from colonial governance to self-rule, and Independence Day is now celebrated with
                        national pride, including parades, cultural events, and reflections on Mauritius&#39;s journey

                    <h2>Dodo</h2>
                    <p>The dodo, an iconic symbol of Mauritius, was a flightless bird endemic to the island. Discovered
                        by Portuguese sailors in the late 16th century, the dodo stood about one metre tall and had a
                        robust, grey body with a distinctive beak. Unfortunately, due to over-hunting by sailors and the
                        introduction of non-native animals, the dodo became extinct by the late 17th century. Despite
                        its extinction, the dodo remains a symbol of Mauritius&#38;s unique natural heritage and a
                        poignant
                        reminder of the impact of human activities on wildlife.</p>

                <h2>Mauritius Kestrel</h2>
                <p>The Mauritius kestrel is the national bird of Mauritius, symbolising the island&#38;s dedication to
                    wildlife conservation. This small, agile raptor was once critically endangered due to habitat loss
                    and introduced predators. However, through intensive conservation efforts, including habitat
                    restoration and captive breeding programs, its population has significantly recovered. The Mauritius
                    kestrel is known for its distinctive plumage and impressive hunting skills, and it now serves as a
                    symbol of hope and resilience in the ongoing efforts to protect and preserve the island&#38;s unique

            <h2>Portuguese Exploration</h2>
            <p>The island of Mauritius was first discovered by Portuguese sailors in 1506. Although they were the first
                Europeans to arrive, the Portuguese did not establish any settlements. Their main interest was in
                navigating trade routes, and Mauritius remained largely uninhabited during their brief exploration.
                Despite this, their discovery marked the beginning of European interest in the island.</p>

            <p>The Dutch were the first to attempt settlement on Mauritius, establishing a colony in 1638. They built a
                small settlement and began cultivating crops, but their efforts were hindered by the island&#38;s harsh
                climate, diseases, and frequent cyclones. The Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, abandoning their settlement.
                However, their brief presence left a lasting mark on the island&#39;s botanical history, including the
                introduction of sugarcane.</p>

            <h2>French Rule</h2>
            <p>In 1710, the French East India Company took control of Mauritius, renaming it Île de France. The French
                developed the island&#38;s economy, particularly focusing on agriculture and the sugar industry. They
                introduced enslaved Africans and indentured labou rers from India to work on the sugar plantations. The
                French era was marked by significant development in infrastructure and the establishment of a robust
                plantation economy that greatly influenced Mauritius&#39;s socio-economic landscape.</p>

            <h2>British Colonial Period</h2>
            <p>The British captured Mauritius in 1810 during the Napoleonic Wars, and the island officially became a
                British colony in 1814 under the Treaty of Paris. The British administration continued the development
                of the sugar industry and implemented various administrative reforms. The introduction of Indian
                labourers as indentured servants significantly influenced the island&#38;s demographic and cultural
                composition. Mauritius remained under British rule until it gained independence in 1968, and the legacy
                of British governance can still be seen in the island&#38;s legal and educational systems.</p>
